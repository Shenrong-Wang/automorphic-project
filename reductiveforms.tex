\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem-functor-compactgroups}
 The functor $G\mapsto G(\mathbb R)$ is an equivalence between: the category of $\mathbb R$-anisotropic reductive $\mathbb R$-groups whose connected components have $\mathbb R$-points, and the category of compact Lie groups. If $G$ is such an $\mathbb R$-group then $G^0(\mathbb R)=G(\mathbb R)^0$. The $\mathbb R$-group $G$ is semisimple if and only if $G(\mathbb R)$ has finite center, and in such cases $G^0$ is simply connected in the sense of algebraic groups if and only if $G(\mathbb R)^0$ is simply connected in the sense of topology.
\end{theorem}
