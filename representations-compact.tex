\tableofcontents


The (complex) representation theory of compact groups, in a nutshell:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item All representations are unitarizable, by averaging an inner product against Haar measure.
 \item All unitary representations decompose into (Hilbert space, i.e., orthogonal and completed) direct sums of finite-dimensional irreducibles (the Peter--Weyl theorem), because operators of convolution by continuous measures are Hilbert--Schmidt (hence compact).
\end{enumerate}


In this chapter, $G$ (or $H$) is a compact group, and we fix throughout the probability Haar measure $dg$. Multiplication of functions by $dg$ turns them into measures which can act on the space of a representation $\pi$, and we feel free to write $\pi(f)$ for $\pi(f dg)$. 

\section{Unitarity}
\label{section-unitarity}

\begin{proposition}
\label{proposition-compact-unitarizable}
 Let $(\pi,V)$ be a representation of $G$ on a space admitting an inner product (positive definite hermitian form). Then, it is unitarizable.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
 Take any positive definite hermitian form $\left< \, , \,\right>'$, and integrate it over the action of the group in order to make it invariant:
 $$ \left<  v, v\right>:= \int_G \left< \pi(g) v, \pi(g) v\right>' dg.$$
\end{proof}

\section{Hilbert--Schmidt property of continuous convolution operators}
\label{section-Hilbert-Schmidt}

Given a Hilbert space $V$, its linear dual $V^*$ is identified with its complex conjugate $\bar V$. We denote by $B(V)=\text{End}(V)$ the space of bounded linear operators on $V$, and by $\hat\otimes$ the Hilbert space tensor product of two Hilbert spaces, i.e., the completion of the algebraic tensor product with respect to the Hilbert norm characterized by $\Vert v \otimes w\Vert = \Vert v\Vert\cdot \Vert w \Vert$.

There is a natural embedding $\bar V\hat\otimes V \hookrightarrow B(V)$, with $\bar v_1 \otimes v_2$ mapping 
to the operator 
$ w\mapsto \left<  w, v_1 \right> \cdot v_2$.
The image is the space of {\it Hilbert--Schmidt operators}, and the Hilbert norm on $\bar V\hat\otimes V$ is the Hilbert--Schmidt norm. Hilbert--Schmidt operators are {\it compact}: they map bounded sets to precompact sets. (It is an easy exercise to prove this, using the explicit expression $\Vert T\Vert_{HS}^2 = \sum_i \Vert Te_i\Vert^2$.)


\begin{proposition}
\label{proposition-continuousconvolution-compact}
 Let $L$ (resp.\ $R$) denote the left (resp.\ right) regular representation of $G$ on $L^2(G)$. For every continuous measure $\mu$ on $G$ the operator $L(\mu)$ (resp.\ $R(\mu)$) is Hilbert-Schmidt and, hence, compact.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
 Let $\mu=h dg$. Then the operator $L(\mu)$ has the integral expression:
$$ L(\mu)(f)(x) = \int_{H} K_h(x,y) f(y) dy,$$
where the kernel is given by:
$$ K_h(x,y) = h(xy^{-1}) dh.$$

The Hilbert Schmidt norm of an integral operator $T$ with kernel $K$ on a measure space $(X,dx)$ is given by:
$$ \Vert T\Vert_{HS}^2= \Vert K\Vert^2_{L^2(X\times X)}.$$
In particular, $L(\mu)$ is Hilbert-Schmidt. (It was important here that the group was compact for the $L^2$-norm of $K_h$ to be finite.) 
\end{proof}



\section{Recollection of spectral theorems}
\label{section-recollection-spectraltheorems}

We recall the following spectral theorems from functional analysis. 

Let $V$ be a Hilbert space. The \emph{adjoint} of a (bounded) operator $T$ on $V$ is the operator $T^*$ with $\left<  T^*v,w\right>=\left<  v,Tw\right>$. An operator $T$ is called \emph{normal} if $T^* T = T T^*$, and \emph{self-adjoint} if $T=T^*$. The \emph{spectrum} $\sigma(T)$ of an operator $T$ is the (closed) subset of all $\lambda\in \mathbb C$ such that $T-\lambda I$ is not invertible. 

The idea of the spectral theorem is that the space $V$ decomposes as an ``integral'' of ``eigenspaces'' of $T$. A familiar case of an integral of eigenspaces is when $V=L^2(\mathbb R)$, in which case the theory of Fourier transform says:
$$V= \int_{i\mathbb R} \left< e^{sx}\right> ds,$$
with the spaces $\left< e^{sx}\right>$ being eigenspaces for all translation operators. 

\begin{theorem}[Spectral theorem for normal operators]
\label{theorem-spectraltheorem-normal}
 If $T$ is a normal operator on a Hilbert space $V$ then there is a measure space $(X,\mathcal B,\mu)$, a measurable function $\lambda: X\to \mathbb C$ and a unitary isomorphism: $V \simeq L^2(X,\mu)$ which carries the operator $T$ to ``multiplication by $\lambda$''.
 
 Moreover, for every measurable $\omega\subset \mathbb C$, let $E(\omega)$ be the projection (restriction) $L^2(X,\mu) \to L^2(\lambda^{-1}(\omega),\mu)$. Then, $E(\sigma(T))=I$, $E(\omega)\ne 0$ for every relatively open nonempty subset of $\sigma(T)$, and $E(\omega)$ commutes with the commutator of $T$ in $B(V)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
 See \cite[Theorem 12.23]{Rudin}. The measure space space $(X,\mu)$ in our formulation is not canonical, but can be obtained from the more canonical formulation of \emph{loc.cit}.\ by considering subspaces of $V$ of the form $\overline{\mathbb C[T]v}$, for $v\in V$. 
\end{proof}



An operator on a Hilbert space is \emph{compact} if it can be approximated in the operator norm by operators with finite-dimensional range. Equivalently, if it maps bounded sets to precompact sets (i.e.\ sets whose closure is compact). 

\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem-spectraltheorem-compact} 
 Let $T$ be a compact self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space $V$, then there is a sequence of eigenvectors $v_n$ with (real) eigenvalues $0\ne\lambda_n\to 0$ (or a finite number of such eigenvalues, if the space is finite-dimensional) such that 
 $$V = \ker T \oplus \hat{\bigoplus}_n \left< v_n\right>,$$
a Hilbert space (i.e., orthogonal and completed) direct sum. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
 See \cite[Theorem 12.30]{Rudin}.
\end{proof}


In particular, all eigenspaces with nonzero eigenvalues are finite-dimensional.


\begin{theorem}[Schur's lemma]
\label{theorem-Schurslemma}
 If $V, V'$ are two irreducible unitary representations of a group $G$, and $T \in \Hom^G(V,V')$, then $T$ is a scalar multiple of an isometry.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
 It is enough to show that the self-adjoint bounded operators $T^* T$ and $T T^*$ are scalars. Let $S$ be one of these operators, and apply the spectral theorem. We claim that the spectrum $\sigma(S)$ is a singleton, hence making $S$ a scalar operator. Otherwise, by Theorem \ref{theorem-spectraltheorem-normal}, for two non-empty, disjoint open subsets of $\sigma(S)$, the corresponding projections $E(\omega_1)$ and $E(\omega_2)$ are non-zero, and have orthogonal images. But these projections commute with the action of $G$, which commutes with $T$, hence $V$ cannot be irreducible.
\end{proof}



\section{Peter--Weyl theorems} 
\label{section-PeterWeyl}

Let $H$ be a compact group, and consider the space $V=L^2(H)$. It is a unitary representation for $G=H\times H$. 

Let $(\pi, V)$ be a finite-dimensional representation of $H$, and consider the matrix coefficient map (see \ref{representationtheory-section-matrixcoefficients})
$$ M_\pi: \pi^*\otimes \pi \to C(H).$$

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma-matrixcoefficient}
For $\pi$ irreducible, the matrix coefficient map is an embedding. For $\pi, \sigma$ irreducible and non-isomorphic, the images of the matrix coefficient maps are orthogonal in $L^2(H)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
 The matrix coefficient map is an embedding (injection), because it is clearly non-zero, and $\pi^*\otimes\pi$ is an irreducible representation of $G=H\times H$.
 
 If $\pi, \sigma$ are irreducible and non-isomorphic, the orthogonal projection from the image of $M_\pi$ to the image of $M_\sigma$ is $G$-equivariant, and since $\pi^*\otimes \pi$ is not isomorphic to $\sigma^*\otimes \sigma$, it has to be zero.
\end{proof}


Notice that the image of the matrix coefficient map consists of \emph{(left and right) finite} vectors (since $\pi\otimes\pi^*$ is finite dimensional). Our goal is to prove:

\begin{theorem}[Peter--Weyl theorem]
\label{theorem-PeterWeyl}
The matrix coefficient maps give rise to a canonical isomorphism
$$L^2(H)\simeq \hat\bigoplus_\pi \pi^*\otimes \pi$$
(Hilbert space direct sum),
where $\pi$ runs over representatives for the isomorphism classes of irreducible, finite dimensional unitary representations of $H$.
\end{theorem}

The word ``unitary'', here, is just to say that the representations $\pi$ come endowed with invariant inner products; according to Proposition \ref{proposition-compact-unitarizable}, every finite dimensional representation of $H$ admits such an invariant inner product, which by Schur's lemma (Theorem \ref{theorem-Schurslemma}, much easier in the finite-dimensional case) is unique up to scaling (exercise!). 

\begin{proof}
 We prove the theorems in steps. 

\begin{itemize}
 \item Let $\mu_n$ be a sequence of approximations of the identity in $H$, i.e.\ positive probability measures whose mass is eventually concentrated in any neighborhood of the identity. Then for any Banach representation $(\pi,V)$ and vector $v\in V$ we have $\pi(\mu_n)v\to v$.
 
 Indeed, $\mu_n\to \delta_1$ in the measure space $M(H)$, and we have seen (Proposition \ref{representationtheory-proposition-integral-Banach}) that the map $\pi: M(H)\to \text{End}(V)$ is continuous.

 
 \item For any subrepresentation $V$ of $L^2(H)$ under the right (or left) regular action, continuous functions are dense in $V$. 

Indeed, it is enough to choose a continuous approximation of the identity and convolve elements of $V$ with it; the convolution of any function with a continuous measure is continuous.

\item Right-finite (or left-finite) functions are dense in any closed, invariant subspace of $L^2(H)$. 

This is the most important step of the proof. Assume to the contrary that there is a non-zero closed subspace $V$ without any right finite functions. We can find a continuous, self-adjoint measure $\mu$ on $H$ such that $L(\mu)V\ne 0$. (Indeed, we can do this by approximating the identity by continuous, self-adjoint measures; here by self-adjoint we mean that the operator $L(\mu)$ is self-adjoint, which is equivalent to $h(g^{-1})=\overline{h(g)}$ if $\mu=hdg$ --- exercise!.) We know (Proposition \ref{proposition-continuousconvolution-compact}) that $L(\mu)$ is compact, hence by the Spectral Theorem \ref{theorem-spectraltheorem-compact} there is a non-zero (real) eigenvalue $\lambda$ of $L(\mu)$, and the $\lambda$-eigenspace is finite-dimensional. But the $\lambda$-eigenspace for $L(\mu)$ is stable under the right action of $H$, hence there are right-finite vectors, a contradiction.

\end{itemize}

Now let $\pi$ be a finite-dimensional irreducible representation of $H$; by the previous point, such representations exist. We have a tautological map $T:\text{Hom}(\pi, L^2(H)) \otimes \pi\to L^2(H)$, where $\text{Hom}$ refers here to the right regular representation. Moreover, the image of $T$ lies in the subspace $C(H)$ of continuous functions. If we endow the space $\text{Hom}(\pi, L^2(H))$ with the action induced from the left regular representation of $H$ on $L^2(H)$, the map $T$ is equivariant. Evaluation at the identity defines a morphism $\text{Hom}(\pi, L^2(H)) \to \pi^*$, whose kernel is (tautologically) trivial. We conclude that the $\pi$-isotypic component of $L^2(H)$ under the right representation (the image of $T$) is isomorphic to $\pi^*\otimes \pi$. Those subspaces, as the isomorphism class of $\pi$ varies, are mutually orthogonal by Lemma \ref{lemma-matrixcoefficient}, and they span a dense subspace, by the points above. This proves the theorem.
\end{proof}


\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem-PeterWeyl-general}
 Every Fr\'echet representation of $H$ contains a dense subspace of finite vectors. In particular, every irreducible Fr\'echet represenation is finite dimensional. Every Hilbert representation of $H$ is the Hilbert space direct sum of irreducibles.
\end{theorem}


\begin{proof}

Choose an approximation of the identity by $L^2$-measures $f_ndh$. By Theorem \ref{theorem-PeterWeyl}, we can approximate $f_n$ in $L^2(H)$, and hence in $L^1(H)$, by left-finite functions, thus there is a sequence of left-finite measures $\mu_n$ such that $\mu_n\to \delta_1$. Then, for any vector $v\in V$ we have: $\pi(\mu_n)v\to v$. This follows from Proposition \ref{representationtheory-proposition-integral-Banach}, together with the (easy) fact that, for compact groups, every Fr\'echet representation is an $F$-representation, in the language of \ref{representationtheory-section-Frepresentations}.

But, for a vector $v\in V$, $\pi(\mu_n)v$ is finite since $\mu_n$ is left-finite. This proves the first claim, and the others follow easily.

\end{proof}




\begin{proposition}
\label{proposition-denseinclusions} 
Assume that $H$ is a compact Lie group (or just a compact group, ignoring mentions of smooth vectors below). We have a sequence of dense inclusions of Fr\'echet spaces:
\begin{equation}
 L^2(H)_{\text{fin}} \subset C^\infty(H) \subset C(H)\subset L^2(H),
\end{equation}
where $~_{\text{fin}}$ denotes left and right finite functions.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
If $H$ is a Lie group, we can show as in the proof of Theorem \ref{theorem-PeterWeyl}, by choosing a smooth approximation of the identity, that any subrepresentation of $L^2(H)$ contains a dense subspace of smooth vectors, and that $L^2(H)_{\text{fin}}$ belongs to the space of smooth functions. 


We then apply Theorem \ref{theorem-PeterWeyl-general} to any of these Fr\'echet spaces, viewed as a represenation of the group $H\times H$. 


 
\end{proof}



\section{The Plancherel formula}
\label{section-Plancherel}

The Plancherel formula expresses a function $f\in L^2(H)$ (using probability Haar measure for the $L^2$-norms throughout) in terms of its \emph{spectral transforms}, which have to be defined as explicit projections onto the summands $\pi^*\otimes \pi$ of the Peter--Weyl theorem. Of course, $f$ decomposes as a convergent sum of its orthogonal projections to those subspaces, but these are not the most natural projections to consider in practice. Instead, the ``natural'' projection is the map
$$ f\mapsto \pi(f dh) \in \text{End}(\pi) = \pi^*\otimes \pi$$
(where $dh$ is the probability Haar measure). 

Hence, the content of the Plancherel formula is the comparison of these ``natural'' projections with the orthogonal ones.

\begin{theorem}
 \label{theorem-Plancherel}
For any $f\in L^2(H)$, we have 
\begin{equation}
 \label{equation-Plancherelformula}
\Vert f\Vert^2 = \sum_\pi \Vert \pi(fdh) \Vert_{HS}^2 \cdot d(\pi),
\end{equation}
 where $\pi$ ranges over all isomorphism classes of irreducible unitary representations of $H$, $d(\pi)$ denotes the dimension of $\pi$, and $\Vert \cdot \Vert_{HS}$ denotes the Hilbert--Schmidt norm on $\text{End}(\pi)$, i.e., the Hilbert norm on $\pi^*\otimes \pi$.
 
 If $f\in C(H)$, then we have 
\begin{equation}
 \label{equation-Plancherelformula-trace}
f(1) = \sum_\pi \text{tr}\left( \pi(fdh) \right) \cdot d(\pi).
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
 Assume that $f \in C(H)$. The right regular action $R(fdh)$ is represented by the kernel $K_f(x,y) = f(x^{-1},y)$, i.e., 
 $$ R(fdh)\Phi(x) = \int \Phi(y) f(x^{-1}y) dy.$$
 
 Calculating the trace of this operator we get, on one hand, 
 $$ \text{tr} R(fdh) = \int_{H} K_f(x,x) dx = f(1),$$
 and on the other, by the Peter--Weyl theorem \ref{theorem-PeterWeyl}, 
 $$ \text{tr} R(fdh) = \sum_\pi \dim(\pi^*) \text{tr}(\pi(f)) = \sum_\pi d(\pi) \text{tr}(\pi(f)).$$
 
 This proves \eqref{equation-Plancherelformula-trace}, and to prove \eqref{equation-Plancherelformula} it is enough to observe that 
 $$ \left< f_1, f_2 \right>_{L^2(H)} = f_1^* \star f_2 (1),$$
 where $f_1^*(g) = \overline{f_1 (g^{-1})}$, and $\star$ denotes convolution (=pushforward by the multiplication map $H\times H\to H$), and 
 $$ \left< T_1, T_2\right>_{HS} = \text{tr} (T_1^* T_2).$$
 (We take the linear factor to be the second one in the hermitian inner products.)
\end{proof}

\section{Example: Spherical harmonics}
\label{section-spherical-harmonics}

We finish this chapter with a classical example, the decomposition of the space $L^2(S^n)$ into irreducibles for the action of $\text{SO}(n+1)$. Here, $S^n$ is the unit sphere in Euclidean space $\mathbb R^{n+1}$, and $G=\text{SO}(n+1)$ is the special orthogonal group of length-preserving linear transformations of determinant $+1$. We follow the notes \cite{Gallier}.

Here, we work with real-valued functions and real Hilbert spaces; the translation to complex-valued functions is immediate, after tensoring by $\mathbb C$. We let $G$ act on the right on $\mathbb R^{n+1}$, and by fixing a base point we have an isomorphism $S^n = \text{SO}(n)\backslash \text{SO}(n+1)$, which proves (inductively) that $\text{SO}(n)$ is compact.

\begin{lemma}
 \label{lemma-polynomials-dense-onsphere}
Restrictions of polynomials on $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ are dense in $L^2(S^n)$. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
 Apply the Stone--Weierstrass theorem.
\end{proof}

The restriction map $\mathbb R[\mathbb R^{n+1}] \to L^2(S^n)$ is not injective. For example, on $S^1 = \exp(i\mathbb R)$ we have $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. 

One proves that it is enough to restrict to \emph{harmonic polynomials}, that is, eigenvalues for the Laplacian $\Delta$ on $\mathbb R^{n+1}$. The proof goes as follows: We define an isomorphism $P\mapsto \partial (P)$ between the algebra of polynomials and the algebra of linear differential operators with constant coefficients on $V = \mathbb R^{n+1}$, given in an orthonormal set of coordinates $(x_i)_i$ by $x_i\mapsto \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}$. (Up to a scalar, this is simply the Fourier transform of a differential operator, when we use the inner product to identify the space $V$ with its dual $V^*$.) Then one easily sees that the pairing 
\begin{equation}
 \label{equation-pairing-homogeneous}
 \left< P , Q\right> = \partial(P) \overline{Q}
\end{equation}
is an inner product on the space $\mathbb R[V]_k$ of homogeneous polynomials of degree $k$, or a hermitian inner product on $\mathbb C[V]_k$.


\begin{lemma}
 \label{lemma-Laplacian-onto}
The Laplace operator
$$ \Delta:\mathbb R[V]_{k+2}  \to \mathbb R[V]_k$$
is surjective for every $k\ge -1$ (setting $\mathbb R[V]_{-1} =0$).  
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
 If $Q\in \mathbb R[V]_k$ is orthogonal to the image of $\Delta$ then for every $P\in \mathbb R[V]_{k+2}$ we have
 $$ 0 = \left < Q, \Delta P \right> = \left< \Vert x\Vert^2 Q, P\right>$$
 (by basic properties of Fourier transform),
 hence $\Vert x \Vert^2 Q = 0$, and therefore $Q=0$.
\end{proof} 
 
The same argument shows
\begin{lemma}
 \label{lemma-harmonic-rest}
If $H_{k+2} \subset \mathbb R[V]_{k+2}$ denotes the subspace of harmonic polynomials ($\Delta P=0$), we have an orthogonal decomposition
$$\mathbb R[V]_{k+2} = H_{k+2} \oplus \Vert x\Vert^2 R[V]_k.$$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
 Indeed, if $P \in H_{k+2}$ and $Q\in R[V]_k$, we have 
 $$\left< \Vert x\Vert^2 Q, P\right> =\left < Q, \Delta P \right> =0,$$ 
 which shows that the two subspaces are orthogonal. By \ref{lemma-Laplacian-onto}, their dimensions are complementary; this proves the lemma.
\end{proof}

This shows:
\begin{proposition}
 \label{proposition-harmonic-ontosphere}
 We have an orthogonal decomposition
 $$ R[V]_k = H_k \oplus \Vert x\Vert^2 H_{k-2} \oplus \Vert x\Vert^4 H_{k-4} \oplus \dots.$$
 The restriction of every polynomial to $S^n$ is equal to the restriction of a linear combination of harmonic polynomials.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
 The first statement follows by induction from Lemma \ref{lemma-harmonic-rest}, and the second because $\Vert x\Vert =1$ on the unit sphere.
\end{proof}

Now, if $\Delta_S$ is the Laplacian on $S^n$, and $r = \Vert x\Vert$ is the radial coordinate, the Laplacian on $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ can be written
\begin{equation}
 \label{equation-Laplacian-decomposition}
 \Delta = \frac{1}{r^n} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left(r^n \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\right) + \frac{1}{r^2} \Delta_S.
\end{equation}

Hence, 
\begin{lemma}
 \label{lemma-eigenvalue-sphereLaplacian}
If $P\in H_k$, then $P|_{S^n}$ is an eigenvector of the Laplacian $\Delta_S$ with eigenvalue $-k(n+k-1)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
 We write $P (r,\theta) = r^k f(\theta)$, with $\theta$ the coordinate on $S^n$, and the result follows from \eqref{equation-Laplacian-decomposition}.
\end{proof}

This leads to the main result:
\begin{theorem}
 \label{theorem-sphericalharmonics}
If $H_k$ denotes the space of harmonic polynomials, homogeneous of degree $k$, on $\mathbb R^{n+1}$, the restriction maps
$$H_k \to L^2(S^n)$$
are injective (allowing us to identify $H_k$ as a subspace of $L^2(S^n)$, and we have an orthogonal direct sum decomposition 
$$ L^2(S^n) = \hat\bigoplus_{k=0}^\infty H_k.$$
This is the decomposition of $L^2(S^n)$ into irreducible representations for the group $\text{SO}(n+1)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
 The restriciton of a homogeneous polynomial to $S^n$ determines the polynomial, therefore the maps $\mathbb R[\mathbb R]_k \to L^2(S^n)$ (and, a fortiori, their restriction to harmonic polynomials) are injective for every $k$.
 
 The Laplacian $\Delta_S$ is a self-adjoint operator; therefore, its eigenspaces corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are mutually orthogonal. This applies to the spaces $H_k$, by Lemma \ref{lemma-eigenvalue-sphereLaplacian}.
 
 By Lemma  \ref{lemma-polynomials-dense-onsphere}, restrictions of polynomials to $S^n$ are dense, and by Proposition \ref{proposition-harmonic-ontosphere}, those are the same as the restrictions of harmonic polynomials.
 
 The group $G=\text{SO}(n+1)$ preserves the metric on $S^n$, therefore its action on $C^\infty(S^n)$ commutes with the Laplacian. In particular, eigenspaces for $\Delta_S$ are stable under $G$. 
 
 [Proof of irreducibility to be added.]
\end{proof}
